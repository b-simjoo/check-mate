# check-mate
A project for my students in University of Hormozgan!

The problem is simple: "Create a program that check state of checkmate for a player in chess". This was a part of the final exam for student of basics of programing at University of Hormozgan.

Program should get an arangment of pieces and color from standard input and print `"mate"` or `"not mate"` to output. I gave another script `tester.py` to students that send samples to stdin and read output from stdout and check output. there is also another script `checker.py` that I use to check answer of all students
